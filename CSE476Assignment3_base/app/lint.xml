    <!--Claude said the following: This is a known issue in Android Studio - it's actually a
    false positive warning that can be safely ignored. The warning appears even when your setup is
    correct. Android Studio's lint checker sees both the XML adaptive icon and the bitmap files
    with the same name (ic_launcher) and flags it as a potential issue, even though this is the
    correct and intended setup for supporting both modern (API 26+) and older Android versions.-->
